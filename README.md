# mnistWithMLP
A project created on 4th year of studies. It is an implementation of Multilayer Perceptron to classify images from dataset MNIST.

After development, saved model was used in previous project - Sudoku Solver. I developed the sudoku solver on the 2nd year (almost 2 years earlier), when I had no clue about machine learning. So this one is a kind of extension of the previously created.
